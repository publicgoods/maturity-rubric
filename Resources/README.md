# Resources

The documents in this folder provide additional information and resources about
the maturity rubric.

The [Framework and Product Evaluation](Framework-and-Product-Eval-Intro.pdf) document 
provides information about DIAL's SDG Development Framework and how a product maturity
rubric supports that work.

The [Product Maturity Models](Product-Maturity-Models.xlsx) spreadsheet contains detailed
information and data that DIAL has collected about the various categories and indicators
that may be collected, including how these indicators map to existing maturity models,
how they may be collected, and their relevance.
